# Description of Application and Userstories
The application will be an adjustable taco-calculator. This means that the application will primarily function as a community based shopping list, which is constantly updated with the help of the users. The purpose of the app is to give an easy to use and easy to modify app that can scale a meal of taco.
*Further information will be added as the app evolves*

## Taco Fridays (User 1)
As per my meal plan, Fridays are for taco. Therefore, I would like to have an easy to access application that shows me all the ingredients. Sometimes I don't want certain ingredients, so it is necessary for me to be able to remove and add ingredients.

### TO SEE
All ingredients and their amount
### TO DO
Add and remove ingredients

## Huge parties (User 2)
As a student that has regular gatherings of a decently large group of students, I need an app where scaling is both simple and fast. Furthermore, the app needs to be able to add a great quantity of weird ingredients, as this is part of our tradition.
